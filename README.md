Notes: 

* Please refer to project_NN/reportandpresentation.pdf for the installation instructions.
* The project was written in November 2017 and has not been tested ever since. Uses Keras with Theano backend: adaptations are possibly required for Tensorflow (order of the image channels, for example).
