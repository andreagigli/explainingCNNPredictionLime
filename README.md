# explainingCNNPredictionLime

Personal implementation of the paper:

Ribeiro, Marco Tulio, Sameer Singh, and Carlos Guestrin. "" Why should I trust you?" Explaining the predictions of any classifier." Proceedings of the 22nd ACM SIGKDD international conference on knowledge discovery and data mining. 2016.

Partially based on the original implementation

Notes: 

* Please refer to project_NN/reportandpresentation.pdf for the installation instructions.
* The project was written in November 2017 and used standalone Keras with Theano backend. It has been recently ADAPTED to use TENSORFLOW KERAS (it does not need standalone Keras and Theano anymore). 
* Due to this adaptation expect some non-optimal implementation. For example, in the function classify_neighbors.. (it definitely needs reworking)
